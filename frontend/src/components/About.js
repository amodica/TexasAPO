            The Alpha Rho chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, founded in 1935, is the premier co-ed service organization at the University of Texas at Austin.

            The objective of the Alpha Rho Chapter is to carry out a program of service benefiting the University of Texas at Austin campus, the Austin community, and the Nation as a whole. Our cardinal principles are Leadership, Friendship, and Service.

            Collectively, our chapter completes over 10,000 hours of community service each semester. Through this service, our brothers grow as friends and develop as leaders. Within our national fraternity, the Alpha Rho chapter is regularly recognized as an exemplary and leading chapter of Alpha Phi Omega. Our brothers are frequently commended by the fraternity, campus, and professional community for their achievements. If you think you’d fit in and help continue this tradition, we’d love to have you.
