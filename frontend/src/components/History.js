                    On March 11, 1935, thirty men met for the purpose of forming a chapter of Alpha Phi Omega at the University of Texas at Austin.  Frank Dominguez III wrote to the national office concerning a petition of affiliation and received information about the fraternity and the requirements to establish a chapter. Shortly later, the Alpha Rho chapter of Alpha Phi Omega was chartered.

                    In the years since, the Alpha Rho chapter has grown to become the premier service organization at The University of Texas at Austin. The chapter welcomed its first co-ed pledge class in 1976.  From running the worlds largest Texas flag, to running the campusâ€™s largest blood drive, the Alpha Rho chapter of Alpha Phi Omega is deeply committed to serving the University of Texas at Austin and the surrounding community.
