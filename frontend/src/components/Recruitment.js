Recruitment for Spring 2020 is now underway!

Pledging Process Overview

Interested in joining one of the nation’s premier service organizations? The Alpha Rho Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega has recruitment every Fall and Spring semester, so don’t delay, join today!

Our pledging process is as simple as 1 – 2 – 3:

0) Find out about APO! Attend some of our information sessions and recruitment events to find out a bit about what we are and what we do. Free food and free friends will be available at all meetings! Also, join our Facebook page for prospective members to keep up with events.

1) Come to Installation. The next Install will be 5PM on February 7th in a location TBH. This is where you officially start your time as a pledge in Alpha Phi Omega!

2) Do that whole pledgeship thing. During the next two months you will have the opportunity to learn more about APO, take part in a wide variety of service projects, participate in leadership development events, make a ton of friends, and did we mention, run the world’s largest Texas flag? Also, if it wasn’t abundantly clear, we are a ZERO HAZING organization. Everyone who completes pledging requirements will be able to join APO.

3) Become an Active Member! Towards the end of the semester, once you have completed your pledge process, you will be eligible to join Alpha Phi Omega as an active member! Congratulations!
